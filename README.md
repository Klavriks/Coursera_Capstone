  #### 1. Introduction 

  New York City is the nation's most attractive destination for visitors. In 2018, New York City welcomed 65.1 million visitors, an all-time high. International visitors comprised 13.6 million of the total, but their economic importance to the City outweighs their numbers because they stay longer and spend more money than domestic visitors. New York City attracts almost one-third of all foreign visitors to the United States. In 2017 visitors to New York City spent more than $44.2 billion while staying here, generating an economic impact totaling more than $70 billion.
