### Part A 

  #### 1. Introduction 

  New York City is the nation's most attractive destination for visitors. In 2018, New York City welcomed 65.1 million visitors, an all-time high. International visitors comprised 13.6 million of the total, but their economic importance to the City outweighs their numbers because they stay longer and spend more money than domestic visitors. New York City attracts almost one-third of all foreign visitors to the United States. 

  My client is international travel company who seeks to investigate what type of restaurants are prevailing in one or the other neighborhood of New York. Coulinary tourism is a growing travel trend. Not just exploration of new cousines and local food delicates what attracts tourists, but very often restaurant options available that are close to their stay play a pivotal role for their holiday eperience. Infromation on what type of restaurants are dominant in different places of New York, will help the travel agents to provide a weighted opinion to their clients over best place to stay. Also, type of local restaurants quite often provides a tip on wellbeing and security of the area, so travellers can estimate people of what nationality they are likely to meet on the streets and what would be the local overnight stay costs.
